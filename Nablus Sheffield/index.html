          <h2>The First Steps</h2>
          <p>Nablus, a Palestinian City in the West Bank, is an unlikely contender for Sheffield to be twinned with at first glance. The surrounding area is filled with refugee camps and Israeli settlements. However, volunteers from Sheffield had already been over to Palestine to help the charity SkatePal construct skate parks for a village nearby to the city. </p>
          <p>In November 2017 MP Paul Blomfield, for Sheffield Central, visited the West Bank, including Nablus and surrounding areas. A member of the Labour Friends of Palestine and the Middle East, his experiences encouraged him to connect with Hakim Sabbah, Director of Project Hope and the Nablus Festival. </p>

          <p>Nablus’ 3rd Annual Cultural Festival is due to take place from 11th April to 20th April 2018. The event showcases local and international culture and soon will be host to actors and skateboarders from Sheffield.</p>

<h2>From Operation Smile to Project Hope</h2>
<p>Hakim Sabbah, Director of Project Hope and the Festival, describes how the organisation dedicated to education and sharing culture grew in the midst of curfews imposed by Israel during 2002 and 2003. The curfews meant, day or night, if any resident left their house in the midst of a curfew they could be shot by the Israeli army. Curfews went on for days, weeks or even months. It was under this atmosphere that Project Hope was created, which in turn led to the creation of the Nablus Festival for Culture and Arts.</p>

<h2>Culture As Resistance</h2>
<p>“Part of what the Israeli aggression against us has been is to eradicate our culture, eradicate our art. This is why for example, last year, at one point there was a fashion show. The Fashion Show was Palestinian embroidered dresses. This was a way to tell the Israelis no, this was not Israeli embroidery, this was Palestinian Embroidery” </p>
<p>“Palestinian music, Palestinian dance, they have been trying to destroy all of this culture.” </p>
<p>“Our role when we have our own cultural festival we want to show our culture, we want to show our dance, we want to show our embroidery.” </p>
<p>“Everything that is part of our identity, so of course it is cultural resistance.”</p>

        <h2><p>Crossing Borders</p></h2>
        <p>Skateboarding is another thing that doesn’t immediately spring to mind when you might think about Palestine, but Charities like <a href="http://www.skatepal.co.uk/">SkatePal</a> have been making a impact in recent years. In an area that doesn’t have a single skateboard shop, there are now four Skate Parks in the West Bank. One is even located on the grounds of a Zoo.
        </p>
        <p>Rob and Nick from The House Skate Park in Sheffield will be visiting them, to help tutor. However, Rob, who runs the House and will be going to Palestine for the first time, said they were keen to not plan too much.</P>
          <p>"We're not really planning it, we don't tend to - over the years we've done a lot of outdoor tutoring stuff, we've done it with schools and youth organisations." <p/>
          <p>"We tend to find we don't over plan it because whenever we do... it doesn't turn out that way!"</p>
        </P>

  <h2> Crafting Stories </h2>
  <p>Val Monti Holland, an Applied Theatre Practitioner based in Sheffield, together with her son, Sam, are bringing Action Methods and Forum Theatre to Nablus. </p>
    <p>Forum Theatre, pioneered by Augusto Boal, is a type of theatre that brings the audience into the performance and can let them change the outcome of a scene. It was originally designed as part of the “Theatre of the Oppressed” as a political tool, but has also has also been adapted for use in many other areas, such as for health, prisons and schools. </p></blockquote1>

        <h2>The Challenges</h2>
        <p>The Nablus Festival, a grass-roots initiative, cannot afford to pay for the travel and accommodation of its performers, so Sheffield Labour Friends of Palestine held a Curry and Ceileidh night on St Patrick’s day. In spite of the snow being brought over by the “Mini Beast from the East” the event was a sell out; and between tickets and a raffle, raised £1600.
      </p> <p>Proceeds of the event went towards the two groups travelling in April, and towards a further visit planned for November which will help continue long term relations.
      </p><p>In addition, an auction at The House Skate Park, of skateboards, wheels and accessories managed to raise £650.</p>

  <body><h2> Hopes for the Future </h2>
<p>Both Rob, Val and Sheffield Labour Friends of Palestine are hoping that people from Nablus will be able to come over to Sheffield in June and help to strengthen links even further.
</p><p>In Particular, Val wishes to showcase Palestinian stories and talent at Migration Matters, a Festival held in Sheffield that is also happens to be in its third year and runs parallel to Rufugee Week. Migration Matters celebrates the contributions Migrants and Refugees have brought into the UK.

<p>Although the Cities are yet to be officially twinned, the Festival has already brought Sheffield and Nablus closer together.</body>
